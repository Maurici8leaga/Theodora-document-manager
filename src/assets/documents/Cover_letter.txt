Hello dear,

I am writing to express my interest in the web designer position at your company. I am a 28-year-old young man with a great passion for web design. I have a strong technical background and experience in a variety of technologies and frameworks, including React, React Native, Redux, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Mongoose, Eslint, Redis, Prettier, Bull, Bunyan, Gulp , MongoDB, Jest, Heroku, Cloudinary, Git, Figma, Jira, Webpack and Vite.

I am a charismatic, determined, curious, creative, organized and detail-oriented person. I like to work in a team, but I can also work independently. I am always willing to learn new things and am always looking for new ways to improve my skills.

In my last project, I was responsible for frontend design, backend development and database. I also worked closely with clients to understand their needs and create solutions that met their objectives.

I am confident that my skills and experience would be a valuable asset to your company. I am available for a personal interview to further discuss my candidacy.

Thanks for your time and consideration.

Sincerely, Mauricio Oleaga
